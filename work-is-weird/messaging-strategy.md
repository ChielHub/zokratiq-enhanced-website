No CV spam. No culture-fit sameness. Just signal, ethos, and people who bring an upgraded reality headset to work.

## Why this exists (short section)

### The problem
Conventional hiring rewards sameness. Curious, reality-attuned thinkers are forced into templates â€” or never apply.

### Our belief
Work should be a place to bring your full self. Hiring should reward unusual attention, depth, and cross-domain synthesis.

### Result
Fewer hires who blend in. More hires who move culture, create leverage, and carry unexpected signal.

## Philosophical resume â€” examples & microcopy

### Lead with a one-line manifesto
*e.g.* "I design decision architectures that make teams less noisy and more wise."

### Signal bullets (3â€“5) â€” combine output + method + impact:
- Built a fortnightly 'Premortem Club' that reduced time-to-decision by 18% across product teams.
- Translated academic frameworks (phenomenology) into a hiring rubric used for 12 hires.
- Prototyped a 'Constraint Playbook' that produced two market pivots in 9 months.

### End with daimonic fit
*e.g.* "I thrive where questions exceed answers and metaphors drive product decisions."

## Visual direction & brand notes
- **Visual mood**: quiet uncanny, warm minimalism, serif headline + monospaced accent for "daimonic" quotes.
- **Palette**: deep indigo (trust), muted ochre (weird warmth), bone white.
- **Imagery**: close, human portraits (not corporate stock) â€” portraits with slight film grain; candid, not posed.
- **Icons**: low-detail, symbolic (lens, knot, compass, broken ladder).
- **Share card visual**: bold "Work is Weird" wordmark over a faded photo of an office window with rain.
- **Animation**: subtle micro-interactions â€” "Pulse" on CTAs that feel like a heartbeat.
